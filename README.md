We have begun our modest attempt to deliver a mature NLP based on the state-of-the-art. Watch out `wink-nlp` unfold over next several weeks.

### Installation

It will be as simple as:

    npm install wink-nlp --save

It will begin to take shape post version 0.0.1. Till then, consider using our [existing NLP packages](https://winkjs.org/packages) such as:
1. [Multilingual tokenizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wink-tokenizer) that tags each token with its type such as word, number, email, mention, etc.
2. English [Part-of-speech (POS) tagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wink-pos-tagger),
3. Language agnostic [named entity recognizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wink-ner),
4. Useful [functions for common NLP tasks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wink-nlp-utils) and [many more](https://winkjs.org/packages).
